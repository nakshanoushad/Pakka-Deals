# Pakka Deals 🛍️

**Smart Buy Advisor – Use Logic, Not Hype.**

Pakka Deals is a lightweight, logic-first decision support tool that helps Indian consumers decide **when** and **where** to buy products. It uses historical sale patterns rather than live price tracking or scraping, ensuring privacy and unbiased advice.

-   **Platform Recommendations**: Suggests the best platform (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, etc.) for specific items.
-   **Sale Predictions**: Identifies upcoming major sales like *Great Indian Festival*, *Big Billion Days*, and *End-of-Season Sales*.
-   **Privacy Focused**: No tracking, no cookies, no affiliate bias.
-   **Lightweight**: Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
